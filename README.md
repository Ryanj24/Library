# Library

JavaScript Library
This project is a basic library app completed as part of the fullstack JavaScript course on the Odin Project. The app allows the user to add their favourite books to their library and allows them to keep track of the books they have completed and those that they are yet to complete along with the ability to remove individual books from the table or erase the entire library.
